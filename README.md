# water-level-height-in-tunnel-detection
It is an algorithm mainly us the OpenCV - Canny Edge Detector to detect the water level height in a tunnel through video frames.

Input a video of water fluiding in a transparent tunnel. 

Output 1: Each frame of this video

Output 2: The cropped roi of each frame

Output 3: The canny detection results of each ROI

Output 4: The pixel coordinated to water level height. Return the marked image and the water level height.
